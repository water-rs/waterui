//! # WaterUI FFI
//!
//! This crate provides a set of traits and utilities for safely converting between
//! Rust types and FFI-compatible representations. It is designed to work in `no_std`
//! environments and provides a clean, type-safe interface for FFI operations.
//!
//! The core functionality includes:
//! - `IntoFFI` trait for converting Rust types to FFI-compatible representations
//! - `IntoRust` trait for safely converting FFI types back to Rust types
//! - Support for opaque type handling across FFI boundaries
//! - Array and closure utilities for FFI interactions
//!
//! This library aims to minimize the unsafe code needed when working with FFI while
//! maintaining performance and flexibility.

/// Defines a trait for converting Rust types to FFI-compatible representations.
///
/// This trait is used to convert Rust types that are not directly FFI-compatible
/// into types that can be safely passed across the FFI boundary. Implementors
/// must specify an FFI-compatible type and provide conversion logic.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// impl IntoFFI for MyStruct {
///     type FFI = *mut MyStruct;
///     fn into_ffi(self) -> Self::FFI {
///         Box::into_raw(Box::new(self))
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// The FFI-compatible type that this Rust type converts to.

/// Defines a marker trait for types that should be treated as opaque when crossing FFI boundaries.
///
/// Opaque types are typically used when the internal structure of a type is not relevant
/// to foreign code and only the Rust side needs to understand the full implementation details.
/// This trait automatically provides implementations of `IntoFFI` and `IntoRust` for
/// any type that implements it, handling conversion to and from raw pointers.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// struct MyInternalStruct {
///     data: Vec<u32>,
///     state: String,
/// }
///
/// // By marking this as OpaqueType, foreign code only needs to deal with opaque pointers
/// impl OpaqueType for MyInternalStruct {}

///
/// This trait is complementary to `IntoFFI` and is used to convert FFI-compatible
/// representations back into their original Rust types. This is typically used
/// when receiving data from FFI calls that need to be processed in Rust code.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementations of this trait are inherently unsafe as they involve converting
/// raw pointers or other FFI-compatible types into Rust types, which requires
/// ensuring memory safety, proper ownership, and correct type interpretation.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// impl IntoRust for *mut MyStruct {
///     type Rust = MyStruct;
///
///     unsafe fn into_rust(self) -> Self::Rust {
///         if self.is_null() {
