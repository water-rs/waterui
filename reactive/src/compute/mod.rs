//! This module provides a framework for reactive computations that can track dependencies
//! and automatically update when their inputs change.
//!
//! The core abstractions include:
//! - `Compute` - A trait for values that can be computed and watched for changes
//! - `ComputeResult` - A trait for types that can be produced by computations
//! - `IntoCompute`/`IntoComputed` - Conversion traits for working with computations
//!
//! This system enables building reactive data flows where computations automatically
//! re-execute when their dependencies change, similar to reactive programming models
//! found in front-end frameworks.
